A MUlti Temporal ANalysis Tool for Rasterdata!

This is a fork from [valuetool](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/valuetool/) which has been extended with new features during the work on my masterthesis called "Analysing multitemporal rasterdata with QGIS".

You can find all newly inserted features under the "Time" tab inside the plugin. (And some more on other places as well)

While working on it I also removed some bugs and nasty behaviour from the "original" valuetool - and probably introduced new ones ;).
Everyone is very welcome to test this plugin and [report issues](https://github.com/mach0/mutant/issues).

Some of the best new introduced features need some Documentation (like the new selection by regexp) but I guess for advanced users it should be pretty much self explaining.

I will write some howto and documentation in my thesis and publish it once (as always) I have more time.

Have fun!
