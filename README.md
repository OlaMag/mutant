A MUlti Temporal ANalysis Tool for Rasterdata!

This is a fork from the original valuetool which has been extended with new features during working on my masterthesis called "Analysing multitemporal rasterdata with QGIS".

You can find all new features under the "Time" tab inside the plugin. (And some more ono other places as well)

While working on it I also removed some bugs and nasty behaviour from the "original" valuetool - and probably introduced new ones ;).
Everyone is very welcome to test this plugin and report issues.

Some of the best new introduced features need some Documentation (like the new selection by regexp) but I guess for advanced users it should be pretty much self expaining.

Have fun!
